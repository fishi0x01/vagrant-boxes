# vagrant-boxes

Vagrant box builds with packer for [VagrantCloud](https://app.vagrantup.com)

Main motivation behind this repo is to stay independent from external sources as much as possible.
Nothing is more frustrating than trying to quickly bootstrap a dynamic workspace and realize that the source box is not available any longer ..

## Windows

Windows boxes are based on scripts from Stefan Scherer's amazing [packer-windows](https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows) repo.
I highly recommend to have a look at it before building your own Windows boxes. He does some really awesome Windows <-> Packer magic there.
